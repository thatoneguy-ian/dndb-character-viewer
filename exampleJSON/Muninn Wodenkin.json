","enemies":"EVIL!!!!","backstory":"We were a tribe of two, my brother and I. Twin boys, born of an outcast Mother. Why she was cast out, we never knew. But she was not like any other Goliaths we've met. She was kind and caring, had a love for nature and all life. For true, it seemed the flowers bloomed with more glory when she was around. A peaceful Goliath is not heard of. Which made being our mother all the harder on her. She could not raise the competitive nature out of us. We had to be better than the other. And it was always Huginn that came out on top. \n\nWe never knew our mother's tribe.  She wouldn't tell us.  Just that she could not travel the mountains anymore, as the tribes would not take kindly to her presence.  She must have been chased out while pregnant.  Giving birth in the woods just south of the mountain range.  Near the River Surbrin of the Cold Wood.  She was able to hide herself, and us as babes, in these woods.  Raised us to early adulthood.  We moved through the forests across the base of the mountains.  Always telling us that we needed to be by each other side, AT ALL TIMES!  Mother was very adamant about this.  We didn't have anyone else to be around, and as kids it was great.  She never spoke of our father.  But the stories she told us over our campfires seemed to always be about one great man.  Huginn and I liked to imagine this great man was our father.  \n\nHe wielded great power and magic.  The magics made us think he was not a Goliath, our people tended to not use the stuff.  She described him as a great leader.  Brought his people amazing gifts and powers.  Built them an incredible home outside of the mortal plane with all they would ever need.  Their home was far from here, and not reachable by most.  But he would venture into our world and walk amongst it's people.  It amused him to no end to hear the tales of mortals.  He had two Ravens with him at most times.  But they would fly through the worlds, gathering information for him.  Mother must have liked these stories a lot, as she named us after these Ravens.  Huginn and Muninn they were called, meaning Thought and Memory.  The stories were always so good to hear.  Sometimes he fought giants of fire and ice.  Sometimes he fought Gods.  Always victorious, but not always without cost.  His son, Tyr, lost a hand once to his step grandchild.  That was a wolf apparently.  Their family is weird.  I'm glad ours is small.  No one here biting my hand off.  Huginn's mouth isn't big enough anyway.\n\nMy brother, he was a great man. Was destined to be at least. We were both reflections and shadows of each other. He was motivated, I was lazy. He thoughtful, I selfish. He was capable, and I was almost...feeble. For a Goliath at least, that's how it felt. No matter what I did, I just could not beat him. Not in any way. Neither of us were big thinkers, but he could twist my brain into knots. It was all in good fun as Huginn never had ill intent. He never hurt me for fun. I earned it. For I would try to find short cuts to everything. \n\nI guess he came out first.  Always had the best of everything.  Stronger, smarter, and apparently more attractive.  I always thought we looked the same.  But as time went on, I got fatter and more scars.  Because I was lazy and got hit more.  Guess they made me ugly.  For the only woman, not our mother, that every came into our loves seemed to like him more.  Kelga, that was her name.  A Shaman from the Elk Uthgardt Tribe.  She too had been shunned by her tribe.  Born with magic in her, she should have been her tribe's Shaman.  But she had no control over it.  Wildly flaring out from her fire would burn the woods in sphere around her.  She was only trying to start a small fire for the night.  It's ok, mother put it out.  Mother was able to help tame her power and get it in control.  Eventually Kelga felt confident enough to try and rejoin her tribe.  She was successful in this.  But she would return to us every now and again, to train with mother some more.  Or seek her help with something above her skills.  She was there when we buried Mother, but came around much less after.\n\nOne day Huginn and I were hunting for dinner in the woods. In the distance we heard something fighting. Just terrible monstrous noises, followed by a man's cries for help. Huginn just looked at me, smiled and ran towards the danger. The fool. Yes, you were a fool. Of course it was brave, still foolish. Anyway, I followed. I always followed. But we got there too late. The beast, or beasts, were gone. Leaving behind the splattered remains of some adventurer. He ran off to track the beast. I looked for the man's money pouch. We may live in the wild, but gold can still be useful when we come across travelers or occasionally go to the local town. I do like the stories the travelers tell of their cities. \n\nThen a stranger came. An old man from a far-off land, covered in a cloak with strange symbols, and a book. We never had any books. But he promised me his book could help me be better than Huginn now, and forever. I just couldn't say no. Greedily said yes without hesitation. He gave me a ring, to give my brother. Said it would make him smarter. I didn't want that, but he promised everything would be as he said. So, I gave it to him. \n\nHuginn said he felt smarter, and that now he would always be one step ahead of his little brother. The prick. \n\nAnother day while out hunting, we heard those same horrible screams and growls coming from far off in the woods. Huginn looked me in the eye, smiled with delight, and ran in its direction. I wasn't fast enough. Lost sight of him, heard their meeting as Huginn announced himself with a brave roar...only to be followed with a wet guttural gurgling cry of pain, then silence. I didn't even hear the creature leave. But it was gone when I arrived. All that was there was my brother. Torn in two. \n\nAfter standing over what was left of his torso for what felt like a day, I howled with heartache I didn't know could exist. I had almost hated him most of our lives, but I absolutely loved him even more. He may have been better than I, but we were a force to be reckoned with, together. Now it was just me, alone. Mother having died years before. I crashed to my knees in crippling sadness. \n\n\nMy eyes scanning his face, his chest. The markings of our kind streak across only the left half of him. Different as we were, I could never deny that looking at him was like looking into a calm river. For I have the exact same markings, reversed on my right side. The vision of what was essentially me, the best of me, lying there, guts spilled out across the forest floor. There, in the blood and gore was a small glint. The ring I gave him was still on his finger. \n\nAt that exact moment I heard a voice come to my mind. \"Take it.\" It whispered. It said again with more force, \"Take it!\" Sliding the ring off his bloody finger, and down my own. From his left hand to mine. His blood left wet lines down my finger. \"Yes, it's going to work.\" The voice scratched again, vaguely familiar. \n\nI lay down by my brother, out of pure mental exhaustion, I slept next to him for the last time. Or so I thought. For when I awoke the ring had linked itself to me. And from within the depths of my own hollow thick skull came the voice of Huginn. \"What have you done?\" I couldn't answer, I didn't know. \n\n\"What have I done?\" Repeating the question out loud as Huginn did in my head. \n\n\"I can tell you.\" Turning to where the words came from, the first ones not coming from in or out of my own head. I saw the cloaked man. He stood there smiling, as though the sight of my dead and destroyed brother's corpse had just given him a king's ransom in gold. Neither Huginn nor I knew how he had done this, nor did we care. Together we reached for Huginn’s greataxe and swung at the man. He gasped as his eyes widened, and blood slowly dripped from his smiling vile mouth. \n\n\"It worked\" were the last words he spoke, as his body fell in two, much like Huginn's. And there standing next to his torn body, was Huginn. Dark grey in color and sort of waving like a distant sight on a hot day. I could see through him. \n\nHuginn turned to look at me over his shoulder. I was still sitting on the ground, next to his body. I hadn't moved. \n\n\"Get up.  We have work to do.\"\n\nOver the following months I traveled the lands looking for anything the old, cloaked man was connected to.  Never found a damn thing though.  I was never that good of a hunter, Huginn did all that stuff.  I still needed to eat.  I tried normal work but, I’m not cut out for that shit.  \n\nThen one day in a local town I saw some tougher looking people collecting money from the head of the town.  And all they brought were some dead Kobolds.  Confused, I asked a nearby local who would pay for dead Kobolds?  That’s when I learned about adventurers, heroes, and missions.  Turns out, most towns had a board where people would put their cries for help, and how much they would pay.  That’s it, I’m going to be an adventurer…  We, we are going to be adventurers.  \n\n\nAll though I hadn’t seen that shadow of Huginn again after the day of his death, he never stopped squawking in my head.  Always with an opinion about what I was doing and how I was doing it wrong.  It’s hard to miss the dead when they stay in your head.\n\nMom had tried to teach me to read; it never really worked out very well.  I just couldn’t make all those squiggles mean anything in my head.  But the other residence of my head could.  If I see it, so does he.  So now it looks like I’m smart enough to read.  What people don’t understand is, it’s just Huginn telling me what I’m looking at.  He definitely took advantage of it a couple times.  Said it was to teach me a lesson about being lazy.  \n\nI don’t see how making me take work to babysit some old crazy lady’s tulip garden taught me anything.  Or when he said it was to get rid of a wyvern terrorizing the town.  But it turned out to be a fully grown dragon.  He says he read it wrong.  But he always laughs when he says it.\n\nTaking these jobs paid for my food.  I was still good at sleeping outside in the woods, so never paid for a room.  Not many people will try to rob a sleeping Goliath.  \n\nIn one of the larger cities, I kept seeing this one dwarf at the job boards at the same time I was.  He’d end up taking the same job I did.  Annoying little hairy bastard.  I don’t want or need his help.  But the people always ended up splitting the payment between both of us.  He always looked pissed off about it too.  This continued for a few weeks until I couldn’t take it anymore, and I pushed him away from the board when he approached.\n\nThis turned into a big fight.  For a little guy, he packs a heck of wallop.  I don’t know how he even lifts that maul of his.  But he swings it hard.  We did some serious damage to ourselves, and the entire block as well.  There was no winner, anyone watching will tell you that.  But Huginn and he swear the Dwarf won.  They’re both jerks.  \n\nNeither of us had any money to cover the damage and ended up behind bars for the destruction we caused.  I could have left that prison anytime I wanted to.  The bars were not strong.  But Huginn kept me straight.  It was stupidity that landed me here, how would more get me out?  I had no idea what he was talking about.  But to shut him I stayed put.  \n\nThe Dwarf never spoke to me.  Spent days next to each other in separate cells, but he just would not speak to me.  I even tried pissing him off to no avail.  He just ignored me.  Later on, he confessed to me that he wasn’t mad.  Just enjoying the free room and food.  Times had been hard on him too.\n\nWhile we waited for time served, the town was attacked by bandits.  Huginn said now was the time to act.  He told me what to say, and I did so.  This happens far more than I’d like to admit.  He also tells me when to keep my mouth shut.  Now was the time to talk.  He had me say a lot that I can’t remember.  But what I do know is, I promised to fight off these attackers.  The jailer seemed unsure but had no backbone of his own, so he let me out.  Before running out at full speed, as Huginn told me to, I rubbed my chin.  It was still sore from when the Dwarf clocked me days before.  \n\nIgnoring Huginn’s demands to “GET TO WORK”, I motioned for the jailer to let out the Dwarf too.  He never spoke Common.  At that time, I didn’t know, but he only spoke Dwarven.  He yelled at me and the jailer at first.  While his cell was being unlocked, I grabbed Huginn’s greataxe and his maul.  He didn’t want to leave, not with me.  Shoved his maul in his chest and nodded towards the screams outside.  \n\n“Get up, we have work to do”.  He looked me in the eyes through his own furled brow.  I didn’t know if he understood me at first.  Grabbing his maul and nodding his head, we ran together out of the jail and went to work.\n\nAfterwards, the mayor thanked us for the help.  But, after looking at the destruction we left in the process, they told us to leave and never come back.  He and I traveled to the next town together.  Neither of us ever said a word.  We didn’t even look at each other.  After arriving in the next town and finding the jobs board, we both stood in front of it.  We found the same types of jobs we had been doing alone and reached for the same one.  Almost mad at each other, ready to fight over the job, Huginn made a suggestion.  So, I backed off from our stare down, turned towards the board and found a job that paid 3 times as much as the other.  \n\nI looked at the Dwarf and showed him the job, pointing at the pay, then at him, and finally me.  We could do bigger jobs if we worked together.  This continued for some months.  Us working together and not talking.  Till one day while camping in the woods, he started talking.  It was all in Dwarven, so I had no idea what he was saying.  But he looked very serious, sad even.  He had something he needed to get off his chest.  And why not confess your sins to someone that can’t understand you.\n\nAfter that, he started teaching me some of his language.  I can speak a little of it today because of him.  Not a lot, but enough to get by.  I was hoping my lessons could continue, then I’d be the first of my brother and I to learn a second language.  He likes to say that I was only ever learning anything because he was now my brain.  But that’s now how this works… right?\n\nWe had spent more time in a bigger city than intended.  Making and spending a lot of money there.  We even started using the inns and got us a room, with BEDS!!  Those things are nicer than I gave them credit for.  Small though.  Apparently, we stayed long enough in one place for his past to catch up with him.  The innkeeper got his attention and handed him a letter.  Immediately, he ran back to our room and got his stuff together.  I tried to follow him, but he put his hand up and shook his head. About to walk away, he looked at my axe.  He had seen me look at his maul many times.  I did like the way it smashed over the axe cutting.  It made a cooler mess.  He grabbed my axe, shoved his maul in my chest, and walked away.  Never saw him again.  Never even learned his name.\n\nHuginn complained about me letting this little man take his axe but, I really like the maul.  It'll be fine brother.  Some of this life has to be mine after all.  I like this better, deal with it.\n\nSoon after, I found myself in the south of the Sword Coast.  I was camping in the woods.  After the Dwarf left, I liked sleeping outside again.  Took less jobs and hunted for my own food.  Found comfort in solitude, almost.  Huginn would complain a lot.  I wasn’t doing enough.  I needed to go and help people.  Stop evil.  And make things right.  I think to myself, “It will never happen.  Nothing I do will ever be enough for him”.  \n\n“So, you will do it, for the rest of your miserable, lazy life!”\n\nI forgot he could hear my thoughts.  This sucks.\n\nA short time later, in the middle of the night, I was jumped by people unknown.  They knocked the lights outta me.  When I woke, I was in a cage.  There were others caged with me.  I had no idea where I was, or who brought me here.  How long was I out?  WHY DO I HAVE SCALES ON MY BACK!?!  I gotta get outta here.  There was ever only one guard at a time.  Just some guy standing in these black and purple robes.  They don’t look tough, but I’ve seen some little guys toss around fire from their fingertips.  He had keys though.\n\nOne night, was it night?  I don’t know, it was always dark and dank in this place.  Anyway, the guards just changed shifts.  Something was different, weird even.  I hadn’t noticed, neither did Huginn, but I could understand them.  Which is weird because, up until now I thought they were speaking in Common.  But no, they sounded like Dragons.  Do I know another language?  But how?  \n\nAnyway, I can’t focus on this now.  Because I saw them hand of keys.  Never noticed that before.  It’s only been a couple days since I woke up.  But I’m not usually very obs, obsvernt… good at noticing things.  I wanted them, needed them to get out.  How was I going to get them.  I’m sure I could knock this guy out with one punch.  As I thought that, I swung at the open air in my cell as hard as I could.  When I did, that shadow of Huginn was suddenly in front of the guard.  And he punched him in the face the same way I did the air!?  This is amazing.  I was right, the guy was out cold.  No one seemed to notice.  \n\nHuginn didn’t disappear.  But he just stood there.  I said out loud, “Get the damn keys brother!”.  \n\n“Shut you mouth idiot.  That isn’t me.  I don’t know what it is, but it’s not me.  I’m still in your head.”\n\nWell, that’s freaking weird.  This is the first time it’s happened since… how would I know how this works?  So, in my head, I again said, “Well, grab the keys.  Get us outta here.”  I could feel Huginn struggling in my head.  “I can’t.” Said Huginn, “I don’t control it.”  After a moment I punched the air again.  It did the same.  So, I control it.  But not in every way.  After trying to get it to pick up the keys, I realized it would not do as I did.  Only when I attacked.  So, I started trying to HIT the keys in my direction.\n\nFuck that took a long time.  But I finally got it to my cell and through the bars.  Once out, Huginn suggested freeing others that were also prisoners here.  Good idea, it will cause more confusion, I thought.  “And it’s the right thing to do”.  Yeah yeah, sure sure.  The right thing to do.  He felt me roll my eyes at him.\n\nOn the way out, there was one separate cell from everyone else.  It had the tiniest window on its door.  When I looked in, I saw this short haired Elvish woman.  But almost half her body looked like a Dragon.  Feeling the scales on my own back, I felt for her.  Huginn said that she looks too far gone, it’s better to leave her.  She might turn on us.  \n\nAs I turned to walk away, she said, “WAIT!  Release me, please.  I must find my sister.  She needs me.”  I felt sorry for her.  So did Huginn.  Against his better judgment, we set her free.  She told me her name; I don’t remember it now.  She said that we were being held by the Cult of the Dragon.  That they were experimenting on us.  Which is why we both now have Dragon scales.  Well, I had scales.  She had claws, and an eye too.  Gross.  Both her and Huginn agreed.  We need to find the rest of this Cult and stop them.  For they are truly evil in doing such things.  Our path led us to a small town called Greenest.\n","otherNotes":null},"traits":{"personalityTraits":"Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable.
